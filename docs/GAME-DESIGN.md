SYMBIOTE-STRAINS is an aesthetically pleasing, enhanced and upgraded version of"Game of Life" by John Horton Conway. Use his randomly procedural generation aspect as a base. We will need to modify and cater the algorithm to be more active, while still mainting the random generations, i simply want to speed it up. The algorithm should be designed to create "Symbiote Strains", these shapes are more root like.

They Key difference in SYMBIOTE STRAINS will be that when a symbiote strain takes over another, it absorbs its cell to its own strain. Think of it like snake, when the snake eats a pebble in that game, it grows larger. This is the same idea, but applies to symbiote strain vs symbiote strain. When an enemy is defeated you get bigger.

The game is called SYMBIOTE STRAINS, and its design is simple.

First you will need to create an optimized algorithm taking all aspects of the game design into play.

# SYMBIOTE STRAINS

## GAMEPLAY LOOP

Five Symbiote strains (teams) represented by colors, will battle on a ULTRA LARGE game board for their strains genetic success.
All symbiote strains are mobile and made up of 4 Key roles. Each role has a different purpose and is represented by a different shape for that strain(team color):

1. Symbiote Slime - The Main or Default Symbiote role, the most abundant role in the game that can mutate into other roles depending on the DNA of the strain and the action it has had ingame.
   - If a Slime is in the vecinity of an attack or defence on the Symbiote Strain, and it survives, it will mutate into 50/50 chance of Role 3: Defender Strain or Role 4: Attack Strain.
   - If a Slime is in an area with abundant other slime, it will mutate into Role 2: Mitosis Sac.
2. Mitosis Sac - This role reproduces the symbiote strain, it should be balanced accordingly for how often it spawns.
3. Defencer Strain - This role is to defend against another strain.
4. Attack Strain - This role is to attack other strains.

## DNA

The DNA of a symbiote strain is a 16 bit integer WITH RANDOM GENERATED STATISTICS.
THE DNA OF ONE SYMBIOTE ROLE SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THE GAME. IF IT REPRODUCES, ITS SPAWN SHOULD BE BASED ON THE DNA OF THE PARENT.

The DNA is made up of 4 parts:

1. Role 1: Symbiote Slime
2. Role 2: Mitosis Sac
3. Role 3: Defencer Strain
4. Role 4: Attack Strain
